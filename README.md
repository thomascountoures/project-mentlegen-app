# project-mentlegen

A project by Thomas Countoures. 

Technologies: 

# back end (currently in progress)

Node. Express as middleware, Mongoose for Object Data Modeling. MongoDB for the database, hosted on mLAB.

# front end?

Planning to use React/Redux for the front end portion. Haven't started this yet. 

# what the heck is this?

It's a bunch of text files with cod3z on them. It will turn into something cool. Like sliced bread. But probably not that cool.
